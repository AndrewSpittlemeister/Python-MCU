# MicroPy
Just some classes and functions that I used when creating microcontroller projects in python.
  - MicroPyInterrupt: Class that allows for repeated timed interrupts that trigger a defined event function.
  - MicroPyStateMachine: Class to aid in using state machines with defined functions for each state.
  - MicroPyBuffer: Class wrapper for a easy to use and robust circular buffer.
  - MicroPyPID: Class wrapper for defining and running a PID control loop.
  - MicroPyRollingAverage: Class wrapper for computing rolling average.
  - byteFormat: Formats data from int/byte/string/bytearray to bytearray. Useful for serial communication.
